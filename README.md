# Shortest-Path-Graph

This is my implementation of Sparse Graph and Shortest Path Searcher using Dijkstra algorithm. 

Details:

• Create a graph in which each vertex represents a site and each edge in between two vertices represents a street. The label of each vertex is the 
incoming edge(street) and of each edge is the cost. 

• Shortest Path Experiment is conducted given that shortest refers to the least cost. 


This is an example of the result of the experiment.
